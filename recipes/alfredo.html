    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fettuccine Alfredo or fettuccine al burro is an Italian and Italian-American pasta dish of fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan. As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich cheese sauce coating the pasta.</p>
    <p>I created this fettuccine Alfredo by modifying my mother's recipe. I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. My girlfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur, and he scrapes the pan every time. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health-conscious!</p>
